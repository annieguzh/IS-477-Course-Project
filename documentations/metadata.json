The project explores how the proportion of high-risk and low-risk inspections in each ZIP code is associated with local housing prices. Data are acquired programmatically from the City of Chicago open data API and Zillow's public research CSVs, cleaned, integrated by ZIP code, and analyzed using a Snakemake-driven workflow."
